variables are containers of values 
variable name = value >>>>>> assigning the variable
variabless 
    integer : is a whole number , no decimal places 
        >>> int 
    string : letters and symbols inside double qoutes
        >>> str
        .......................
rules should be followed when deal with variables at python 
1- names contain letters , numbers , and underscoures
2- space is not allowed in the name 
3- sensetive .. capital C is not same as smaller c 
4- variable can not be keywords like and , break or try
    to know more about python keywords write this code 
        import keyword 
        print(keyword.Kwlist)
        ...........................
working with numbers 
    + >> add
    - >> substract
    ** >> exponent
    / >> division
    // >> didvision without a reminder
    % >> if you wanna get the reminder only 


floats >> any number with a decimal point 
strings >> can be used for letters, numbers, symbols and spaces 
     they are between begining and ending quotes ""
        ..............................
python does not take a considerations of white-spaces
    ecxept when you write the keywords that make a function.
    they are important to read code easily 
        ...............................
comments is very important to declare all non-understanding codes
