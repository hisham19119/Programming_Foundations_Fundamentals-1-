1- With if-else statements, we will always execute one of the code blocks depending on the result of the condition test.
ans : TRUE

2- Which operator will you use to return true if two variables are different?
ans : !=

3- Which if-else statement will not produce this output?
    is divisible by 3
ans : num = 16
 if num % 3 == 0:
  print("is divisible by 3")
 else:
  print("is not divisible by 3")

4- Any expression that breaks down to either true or false is called a conditional, or _____.
ans : boolean expression

5- This if-else statement is written in _____.
    if "apples" == "apples"
  puts "You're comparing the same thing"
 end
ans : Ruby

6- Which of these is not a relational operator?
ans : =

7- What is the issue with the following code?
 
    number = input("Enter a number: ")
    if number == 10:
    print("The number is greater than 10.")
    else:
    print("The number is less than 10.") 

    ans : The conditional statement is checking for equality.

8- What is the output of this program?
 

    num = 16
    if num % 3 == 0:
    print(num, "is divisible by 3")
    print("The end")
ans : The end

9- Multiple statements grouped together are called a _____.
ans : block

10- Which code can you use to print if a test score is a pass or a fail?
ans : if (score>=60):
  print("passed")
 else:
  print("failed")

11- What will the following condition print?
 
    if (num>=0):
    print(num)
    else:
    print(-1 * num)
ans : the absolute value of num

12- What is the output of the following program?
 

    number = 10
    if number % 4 == 0:
    print(number, "is divisible by 4")
    print("All done")
ans : All done
